# Jelly_Balls
Welcome to my Unity beginner Project!
This project is made to C# basic code for making a game easier.
I want to show for beginner how to make "SHAKE DETECTION", "SAVE AND LOAD" and "MAKING A SHOP" in Unity Android.
### SHAKE DETECTION
Unity has detection of device acceleration so we can use "Input.acceleration" if you want to detect the device inclination.
